# alt:V JSv2 Client Module updater

Download the [jsv2](https://github.com/altmp/altv-js-module-v2) client module and update it in alt:V launcher files.

> _Note: This script was not created by the alt:V team._

## Configuration
1. Create a configuration file ``.jsv2-client-updater.json``. This is also created when the script is run for the first time, if it doesn't already exist.
2. Define ``altVPath`` in the configuration file. This must be the path to the directory where ``altv.exe`` is located.
